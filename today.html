            <h1>ABOUT THAT ARTSY TILEWORK</h1>
            <p>People inside and outside the MTA realized that losing this much artsyness was not the best move, as it made the whole system really dull in the first place. So they started reverting some of the 1970s-era renovations back to that artful form, as well as taking the creative freedom to change up some tilework that were based off the IND at BMT stations to tilework that would be more faithful to the BMT.</p>

                    <p>This station was originally built with the IND style of tilework...</p>

                    <p>But was transformed into more of a BMT style based off of Vicker's earlier works. Looks nice! (Though I do question if revising this type of tile history is even it.)</p>

            <h1>BUT THAT CRAPPY TILEWORK STILL REMAINS?</h1>
            <p>Yeah, but only to a limited extent. I guess that tilework was too good for when that fool decided to commandeer the MTA and do some special renovations that barely did anything to the subway system.</p>

                    <p>And an after. The yellow tiles were replaced by blue ones, but that weird glazed wall tiles still stay somehow. Also note those displays--that was the one truly successful part of this renovation project.</p>
