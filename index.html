            <h1>Welcome to the Subway Sign Info!</h1>
            <p>This is the site where you can find out some cool history about transit signs of the past throughout different eras--from the days when people had to make signs by hand to the present era, when we have cool things called computers to help us design cool signages!</p>
            <p>This site will primarily cover signage in the North American continent, as this is what the author of this website is most familiar with! He's still at large trying to be a foamer of all the other transit systems around the world.</p>
            <p>This website is designed to attempt to faithfully replicate some of the most celebrated transit graphic design in the world, such as using the Toronto Subway and Helvetica fonts!</p>
