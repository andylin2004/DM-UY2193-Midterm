            <p>Yep...that did happen.</p>
            <p>Remember that whole value-oriented-ish tilework that Vickers had to do? Well, thanks to the changing times that placed less emphasis on actual artsyness and more on making things look more geometric and simpler (as well as trying to cut costs, as this next phase occurred in the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the US was basically in the Great Depression), his style changed substantially.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The tilework on the right almost gives off that type of impression that there's no artsyness involved--its a very strict system that it's pretty cheap to implement, but has less life than earlier Vicker's works of earlier.</p>
            <p>Although this tilework was designed for a third subway agency in New York, run by the city themselves (the IND), this tilework would unfortunately creep into other then-new build station onto the BMT too.</p>

                    <p>One of the stations that unfortunately had the IND tilework creep onto the BMT, 8th Ave on today's L train. Very plain and the transition from the more intricate tilework of the previous stations to this simplified tilework here might be kinda disturbing.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Vickers would go on with more subway tile work until 1942. But even after he left, his influence can be seen elsewhere in the system. However, some slight architectural changes were made.</p>

                    <p>The text mosaic may not have changed up, but the tiles around it definitely changed substantially.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This new tile technology would be implemented in different forms from the 1950s to the 1970s. This can be seen as the death of artsy tilework, as even some stations with the artsy tiles of the yesteryears were lost to this technology for at least 30 or so years, partially for platform extensions, and partially because the old tilework was decaying and people back then didn't realize how important it is to preserve history.</p>
