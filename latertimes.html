            <h1>STANDARDIZATION GALORE!</h1>
            <p>Yep...that did happen.</p>
            <p>Remember that whole value-oriented-ish tilework that Vickers had to do? Well, thanks to the changing times that placed less emphasis on actual artsyness and more on making things look more geometric and simpler (as well as trying to cut costs, as this next phase occurred in the late 1920s and early 1930s, when the US was basically in the Great Depression), his style changed substantially.</p>

                    <p>...And hello simple structure, simple blocks of text, and simple tilework!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The tilework on the right almost gives off that type of impression that there's no artsyness involved--its a very strict system that it's pretty cheap to implement, but has less life than earlier Vicker's works of earlier.</p>
            <p>Although this tilework was designed for a third subway agency in New York, run by the city themselves (the IND), this tilework would unfortunately creep into other then-new build station onto the BMT too.</p>

                    <p>One of the stations that unfortunately had the IND tilework creep onto the BMT, 8th Ave on today's L train. Very plain and the transition from the more intricate tilework of the previous stations to this simplified tilework here might be kinda disturbing.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Vickers would go on with more subway tile work until 1942. But even after he left, his influence can be seen elsewhere in the system. However, some slight architectural changes were made.</p>

                    <p>The text mosaic may not have changed up, but the tiles around it definitely changed substantially.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This new tile technology would be implemented in different forms from the 1950s to the 1970s. This can be seen as the death of artsy tilework, as even some stations with the artsy tiles of the yesteryears were lost to this technology for at least 30 or so years, partially for platform extensions, and partially because the old tilework was decaying and people back then didn't realize how important it is to preserve history.</p>

                    <img src="imgs/grandst.jpg">
                    <p>But there were stations that were literally built with this new tile technology (as they were built in the 1950s-1960s). I'll excuse these as at least these works aren't covering up any good art form.</p>

            </div>
            <h1>AN ACTUAL STANDARDIZATION THINGY NOW?</h1>
            <p>Yep, you heard that right. A lot of crazy mergers happened between the early 1900s and the 1960s that kind of led up to this. In 1940, the city bought out the two other subway companies (because the city made it really hard for the other two companies to make a profit by locking in fares at 5Â¢). Then in 1967, after a lot of bickering over if the state or the city should run the subway system just so that it could collaborate with other transit agencies in the NYC area more effectively, the state government took over NYC's subway system. Since the three systems have been fragmented for so long and the transit system began to defragment the three systems by creating track connections between the different systems and running trains that goes through these connections, they needed a new way to communicate how service would run (as the signs of the old day, including the fragmented subway map situation, needed to go). They decided to hire Vignelli and Noorda to design a new design standard for signage throughout the system.</p>

                    <img src="imgs/vignellimap.jpg">
                    <p>As part of the new signage system for the MTA, Vignelli also came out with this new Vignelli subway map, which was a more abstract way of showing the subway system than before. This subway map was geographically less accurate than the maps of yesteryear, which posed an issue for some commuters who wanted to go to a relative geographic area, but it was easier for someone to try and navigate the system with this map. This map would last until 1979, when the MTA decided to drop this map in favor of a map that was more geographically accurate and used colors to properly group lines based on where they run in Manhattan.</p>

            </div>
            <h1>VIGNELLI SUBWAY ARCHITECTURE!?</h1>
            <p>Yep, that's a thing too. Remember that new tile tech? Vignelli's influence pierced through that too. Unfortunately, it also destroyed all that artsy tile work.</p>
            <div class="photogrid">
                <div>
                    <img src="imgs/53st.jpg">
                    <p>You can definitely tell Vignelli's method to the madness with this tilework. His sign style system literally permeates through this station (although the metal sign here is unfortunately after his time, as the MTA would switch from Vignelli's Standard font to Helvetica in 1989).</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>But as the MTA modernized their design language, some people thought they lost too much of the artsyness of older subway stations from all this tilework in this era of station rehabilitation. And as we hop to today, we can see that they're really taking the best of the past.</p>
